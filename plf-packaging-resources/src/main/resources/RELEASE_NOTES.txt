= II. STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS =

The file README.txt contains information on how to start the product.

= III. UPGRADE NOTES =

The upgrade procedure is only guaranteed and tested to be transparent from the previous maintenance version (x.y.z from x.y.z-1). So, we recommend to apply upgrade procedures for all versions between your current and the target one.
However, if you still insist on skipping versions, we strongly advise to read all upgrade notes of the versions you are skipping to see if your project is impacted by any previous upgrade procedure.

== Upgrading from the previous Platform version ==

* Prepare bundle:
** If eXo Platform is connected to a populated organizational data source, Organization Integration Service must be activated so that the data are synchronized. Please refer to chapter 7 "LDAP Integration" in Administrator Guide for the detail.
** Go to $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/ folder (Tomcat bundle) or $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/gatein/ folder (Jboss bundle).
** Rename upgrade—sample.properties to upgrade.properties
* Start server. The upgrade will be run automatically.
* Stop server.
* Remove/Rename the file upgrade.properties
* Restart the server. You're ready.

== Upgrading from Platform 4.4.1 to ${org.exoplatform.platform.version} ==

=== Description of the plugins used in this upgrade ===

# PLF-7088 Problem while naming contents using apostrophes
commons.upgrade.NodeTypeTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=true

== Upgrading from Platform 4.4.0 to 4.4.1 ==

=== Description of the plugins used in this upgrade ===

# PLF-7186 Search Indexing Management page does not appear after PLF upgrade
commons.upgrade.Upgrade-PortalData.enable=true

# ECMS-7595: Cannot download a document : the Download button is not visible
commons.upgrade.NodeTypeTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=true

=== Search ===

* JCR data must be reindexed in order to apply the fix PLF-6326 for existing contents.
* Elasticsearch spaces index must be recreated in order to apply SOC-5549

=== Troubleshooting ===

In a cluster environment, database locks issues can happen when starting the nodes the first time after the upgrade.
The best solution to fix this is to start and stop completely one of the nodes to do the upgrade, then start the cluster.

== Upgrading from Platform 4.3.1 to ${org.exoplatform.platform.version} ==

=== Description of the plugins used in this upgrade ===

#PLF-6737: No signature of method: static org.exoplatform.services.deployment.Utils.sanitize() when using the Announcement template
commons.upgrade.NodeTypeTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=true

In addition, upgrade scripts are automatically run at startup in this version to migrate wiki and social data from JCR to JPA.
Wiki data migration is done synchronously, meaning that the eXo Platform instance will be available only once the data migration is done.
Social data migration is done asynchronously, meaning that the data migration will run after the eXo Platform start.

=== Architecture changes ===

Since the version 4.4.0, eXo Platform requires Elasticsearch.
eXo Platform is shipped with an embedded version of Elasticsearch which automatically starts when eXo Platform starts.
This embedded Elasticsearch instance is recommended for development and test but not for production.
For production it is recommended to run a standalone Elasticsearch cluster (please refer to Elasticsearch official documentation for more details).
In order to use a standalone Elasticsearch cluster, the following properties must be defined in exo.properties:
* exo.es.embedded.enabled=false - Disable the default Embedded Elasticsearch
* exo.es.index.server.url=<indexing_URL> - URL of the node used for indexing
* exo.es.search.server.url=<searching_URL> - URL of the node used for searching

For advanced configuration and more details please refer to the eXo Platform documentation.

=== Unified search ===

*  Data must be reindexed in order to apply the fix INTEG-458 for existing contents.

== Upgrading from Platform 4.3.0 to 4.3.1 ==

* Prepare bundle:

** Go to $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/ folder (Tomcat bundle) or $PLATFORM-${org.exoplatform.platform.version}-JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/gatein/ folder (Jboss bundle).
** Rename upgrade-4.2.1-to-4.3.0—sample.properties to upgrade.properties

=== Disable-user feature ===

- Notice that you need to upgrade user database only if you use disable-user feature with PicketlinkIDM organization service implementation, for other implementation such as: jdbc implementation, you don't need to active the upgrade plugin for upgrading user data.
- If you don't want the “disable-user” feature (so you don't need to upgrade your user database when using PicketlinkIDM), you can add this to exo.properties configuration file
exo.disable.user.activated=false. The feature will be hidden from PLF, and the disable-user upgrade plugin is also ignored

== IV. KNOWN ISSUES ==

* ECMS-6818: Remote edit does not work on Chrome 42
* EXOGTN-1963: SPNEGO doesn't work when using Firefox client on the same Window 8 with PLF 4.2
