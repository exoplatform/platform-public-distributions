System requirements
------------------------------

    * CPU:     Multi-core recommended, 2GHz minimum.
    * Memory:  The eXo Platform package is optimized with default settings: max heap size = 4GB and non-heap size = 256MB; so the available memory should be at least 4GB. It is recommended you have a memory of 8GB (4GB free for database, Elasticsearch, Jitsi and Onlyoffice services and file system caches).
    * Disk:    10GB (depending of the amount of data)
    * OS:      Windows or Linux
    * JDK:     Java 17 (Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable)
    * Browser: Check Browser compatibility section in Supported Environment https://www.exoplatform.com/supported-environments
    * The eXo Platform server will run on port 8080, make sure this port is not currently in use
