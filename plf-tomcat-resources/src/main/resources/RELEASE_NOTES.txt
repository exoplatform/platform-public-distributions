III. UPGRADE NOTES
===================
 
 
The upgrade procedure is only guaranteed and tested to be transparent from the previous maintenance version (x.y.z from x.y.z-1). So, we recommend to apply upgrade procedures for all versions between your current and the target one.
However, if you still insist on skipping versions, we strongly advise to read all upgrade notes of the versions you are skipping to see if your project is impacted by any previous upgrade procedure.
 
If you want to migrate to Platform 4.0.6 from Platform 3.5.x or previous versions, please contact eXo Support.

---------------------------------------------------------
 
* Prepare bundle:
** If eXo Platform is connected to a populated organizational data source, Organization Integration Service must be activated so that the data are synchronized. Please refer to chapter 6 in Administrator Guide for the detail.

** The following upgrade plugin must be activated in the $PLATFORM-4.0-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/configuration.properties (Tomcat bundle) or $PLATFORM-4.0-JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/gatein/configuration.properties (Jboss bundle) file:

# PLF-5104 (only if acme extension is deployed)
commons.upgrade.NodeTypeTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=true

** Remove the index folder for collaboration workspace (which is located at data/jcr/index/collaboration_portal). This step is mandatory because of the new indexing configuration for ECMS and WIKI contents.
   Indexing might take time and memory depending on your data size.
   In case of huge data, you need to either (1) increase heap size (-Xmx in JAVA_OPTS) or (2) reduce JCR Jboss cache size (gatein.jcr.cache.size inside configuration.properties) so that the indexing can finish without Out of Memory error.
* Start server. The upgrade and re-indexation will be run automatically.  
* Stop server.
** Deactivate the above upgrade configuration:
   commons.upgrade.SiteExplorerTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=false
   commons.upgrade.NodeTypeTemplateUpgradePlugin.enable=false
** Reset the value of heap size or JCR Jboss cache size if you changed them for indexing purpose.
* Restart the server. The upgrade process is done.
